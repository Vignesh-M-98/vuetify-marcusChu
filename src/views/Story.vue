      <p class="mb-3 md:mb-4 lg:mb-5 xl:mb-6">Mr Chu started his journey from humble beginnings, going through a few sales roles in his younger days before building his life’s work and legacy at ERA. For the taxi driver’s son, the hunger for bigger things and willingness to get his hands dirty landed him at the doorstep of ERA in 1996, at the age of 28.</p>
      <p class="mb-3 md:mb-4 lg:mb-5 xl:mb-6">At that time, joining the real estate business was tough. The industry was in it’s earlier years, and did not have the robust support and infrastructure seen today. However, none of this mattered to Mr Chu. He rolled up his sleeves, and started doing calls using office phones, and even 10c payphones at void decks to land his his first few clients. To stay lean, he drove a beat up Toyota.</p>
      <p class="mb-3 md:mb-4 lg:mb-5 xl:mb-6">In 1997, he was named ERA’s top new sales agent. 2 years later, he was named Top Agent. As his career started to advance rapidy, Mr Chu pivoted to thinking about grooming a new generation of real estate industry leaders, and how to pave the way forward for the real estate industry.</p>
      <p class="">20 years later, the fruits of his labour are evident in the massive impact he has had on the industry.</p>

      <p class="mb-6 ">Today, as CEO, Mr Chu leads the charge with more than 8,000 agents in Singapore alone. (Not including thousands more in the wider region that work under the ERA umbrella.) His work includes 3 key areas:</p>
      <p class="mb-6 ">Grooming and building the next generation of real estate leaders - Mr Chu has a deep belief in handing over the right mindsets, skills, and drive to the next generation. He is confident that by doing this, there will be a strong, unbreakable organisation in place to take ERA to greater heights.</p>
      <p class="mb-6 ">Spearheading ERA to it’s next level of growth - ERA now has 18,000 agents in 646 offices across 10 countries. At this stage of growth, Mr Chu looks forward to the future, and continues to strive for bigger growth and achieving the next level of breakthroughs.</p>
      <p class="">Harnessing the power of digital technologies - A throwback to the founding principles of ERA (Originally called Electronic Realty Associates), Mr Chu stands behind the fact that harnessing technology is a philosy in ERA, with in-house apps, customer relationship platforms, mobile applications, and other cutting-edge technologies.</p>
